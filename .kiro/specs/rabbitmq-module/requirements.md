# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for integrating RabbitMQ as a pluggable module within the CGCG API's hybrid architecture. The RabbitMQ module will provide message queuing capabilities as a self-contained feature that can be easily enabled, disabled, or extended.

## Glossary

- **CGCG_API**: The main FastAPI application with hybrid architecture
- **RabbitMQ_Module**: A self-contained module providing RabbitMQ message queuing functionality
- **Message_Queue**: A communication mechanism that allows asynchronous message passing between services
- **Celery_Worker**: A distributed task queue system using RabbitMQ as message broker
- **Direct_Messaging**: Low-level RabbitMQ messaging using pika library for custom patterns
- **Task_Queue**: High-level task management system provided by Celery
- **Connection_Manager**: A component responsible for managing RabbitMQ connections and channels
- **Message_Broker**: RabbitMQ server acting as intermediary for message passing

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to integrate RabbitMQ messaging capabilities into the CGCG API, so that I can enable both high-level task queues and low-level messaging patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL be implemented as a self-contained module under `app/modules/rabbitmq` following the existing module pattern
2. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL support both Celery task queues and direct RabbitMQ messaging via pika
3. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL provide connection management functionality for RabbitMQ servers
4. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL expose REST API endpoints for both task submission and direct messaging
5. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL include configuration settings in the main CGCG_API settings
6. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL follow the established module pattern for easy enable/disable capability

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure RabbitMQ connection settings through environment variables, so that I can deploy the API in different environments without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL add connection parameters to the Settings class in `app/core/config.py`
2. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL support configurable host, port, username, password, and virtual host settings
3. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL provide default values for all configuration parameters
4. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL validate configuration parameters on startup
5. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL follow the existing Pydantic settings pattern used by other modules

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to submit Celery tasks and publish direct messages via REST API, so that I can choose the appropriate messaging pattern for each use case.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL provide endpoints to submit Celery tasks with task name and parameters
2. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL provide endpoints to publish direct messages to specified queues
3. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL accept message payload, queue name, and optional routing parameters
4. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL validate task parameters and message format before processing
5. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL return task IDs for Celery tasks and message IDs for direct messages
6. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL handle connection failures gracefully with proper error responses

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage RabbitMQ queues through REST API endpoints, so that I can create, inspect, and manage queues programmatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL provide endpoints to declare queues with configurable properties
2. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL provide endpoints to check queue status and message counts
3. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL provide endpoints to purge queues when needed
4. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL validate queue names and properties according to RabbitMQ standards
5. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL handle queue management errors with descriptive error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor and manage Celery tasks through REST API endpoints, so that I can track task execution and handle task lifecycle management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL provide endpoints to check Celery task status by task ID
2. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL provide endpoints to list active, pending, and completed tasks
3. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL provide endpoints to revoke or cancel running tasks
4. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL return task results and error information when available
5. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL handle Celery worker connection issues with appropriate error responses

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the RabbitMQ module to integrate seamlessly with the existing CGCG API architecture, so that it follows established patterns and conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL follow the established module structure with router.py, schemas.py, service.py, and __init__.py files
2. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL include router integration in `app/api/v1/api_router.py` following existing patterns
3. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL use Pydantic models for request/response validation in schemas.py
4. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL include comprehensive error handling following API patterns
5. THE RabbitMQ_Module SHALL be testable using the existing pytest framework and patterns
