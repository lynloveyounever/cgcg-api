# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Deadline Module provides integration with Autodesk Deadline render farm management system, enabling users to monitor and manage rendering jobs through the CGCG API. This module allows retrieval of job information, status monitoring, and basic job management operations.

## Glossary

- **Deadline_System**: The Autodesk Deadline render farm management software
- **CGCG_API**: The main FastAPI application that hosts the deadline module
- **Deadline_Job**: A rendering task submitted to the Deadline system
- **Deadline_Repository**: The central database and file system where Deadline stores job and worker information
- **Deadline_WebService**: The HTTP API interface provided by Deadline for external integrations
- **Local_Deadline_Service**: The service component within CGCG_API that handles HTTP communication with Deadline_Repository
- **Job_Status**: The current state of a rendering job (e.g., Queued, Rendering, Completed, Failed)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a render farm supervisor, I want to retrieve a list of all jobs from Deadline, so that I can monitor the current workload and job statuses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/v1/deadline/jobs, THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL send HTTP requests to the Deadline_Repository
2. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL retrieve job data from the Deadline_Repository within 30 seconds
3. IF the Deadline_Repository is unavailable, THEN THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL return an empty list with HTTP 200 status
4. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL include job ID, name, status, and user information for each Deadline_Job
5. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL handle HTTP errors from Deadline_Repository gracefully without exposing internal errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a render farm supervisor, I want to retrieve details of a specific job, so that I can investigate job-specific issues or progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to /api/v1/deadline/jobs/{job_id}, THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL send HTTP requests to the Deadline_Repository for the specific job
2. IF the job_id does not exist in Deadline_Repository, THEN THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL return HTTP 404 status with appropriate error message
3. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL include comprehensive job details including frames, progress, and error information
4. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL validate the job_id format before making requests to Deadline_Repository

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a render farm supervisor, I want to receive notifications when job statuses change, so that I can respond quickly to failed jobs or completed renders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Deadline_Job status changes, THE CGCG_API SHALL publish a message to the message queue
2. THE CGCG_API SHALL include job ID, previous status, new status, and timestamp in the notification message
3. THE CGCG_API SHALL handle message publishing failures gracefully without affecting job monitoring
4. WHERE message queue is unavailable, THE CGCG_API SHALL log the notification attempt and continue operation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure Deadline connection settings, so that the module can connect to different Deadline installations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL read Deadline_Repository URL from environment configuration
2. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL support authentication credentials for Deadline_Repository access
3. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL validate connection settings during application startup
4. WHERE configuration is invalid, THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL log appropriate error messages and disable Deadline functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot integration issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL log all HTTP requests to Deadline_Repository with timestamps and response codes
2. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL provide structured error responses for client applications
3. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL implement retry logic for transient Deadline_Repository connection failures
4. THE Local_Deadline_Service SHALL maintain service availability even when Deadline_Repository is completely unavailable
